# NO_DEPLOY Evidence

Generated by: CI Hardening script

This file lists workflows/jobs that must be gated by `DEPLOY_ENABLED` and commands indicative of deployments.

Workflows detected missing NO_DEPLOY guards (preliminary):

- `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/integration-tests-with-compose.yml`
- `.github/workflows/load-testing.yml`
- `.github/workflows/scan-econeura.yml`
- `.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml`

Please review and add guards like `if: env.DEPLOY_ENABLED == "true"` or set `DEPLOY_ENABLED`/`SKIP_RELEASE` envs as appropriate.

# GitHub Copilot & VS Code recommendations

This project recommends the following VS Code extensions for developer productivity and for working with the repository's GitHub Actions / Azure workflows:

- GitHub Copilot (`GitHub.copilot`) — inline AI suggestions.
- GitHub Copilot Chat (`GitHub.copilot-chat`) — conversational code assistance.
- Azure Account (`ms-vscode.azure-account`) — manage Azure sign-in.
- Azure CLI (`ms-azuretools.vscode-azurecli`) — run `az` commands from VS Code.
- Azure Functions (`ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions`) — helpful if you work on function apps.

We add `.vscode/extensions.json` to recommend these extensions and a minimal `.vscode/settings.json` to enable inline suggestions for the workspace.

If you don't want to install Copilot, ignore the recommendation — the project does not depend on it.

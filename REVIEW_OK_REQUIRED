REVIEW_OK_REQUIRED
This repository requires a manual security review of the dry-run artifacts before creating REVIEW_OK.
Do NOT create REVIEW_OK until you have inspected:
 - audit/ai_run_dry_*.json (masked)
 - audit/planned_files_*.json
 - audit/summary_dryrun_*.txt
To authorize a real run, a security lead must create a file named REVIEW_OK in the repo root and commit it.

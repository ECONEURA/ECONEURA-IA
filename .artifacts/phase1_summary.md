Phase 1 summary

Actions performed:
- Preflight checks: node v20.19.5, pnpm 8.15.5, gh CLI unauthenticated.
- Installed workspace dependencies with `pnpm -w install`.
- Ran linters and typecheck (commands executed; no blocking failures recorded).
- Attempted to start `@econeura/api` dev server; runtime imports were missing. Created shims for missing routes under `apps/api/src/routes/` and JS proxies to satisfy ESM `.js` imports. This allowed partial startup attempts.
- Snapshot: copied `apps/api/openapi.json` → `.artifacts/openapi.snapshot.json` (used as OpenAPI snapshot for now).
- Ran jscpd duplication scan on:
  - `apps/api/src` → `reports/jscpd.api.json/jscpd-report.json`
  - `apps/*/src` (scoped earlier) → `reports/jscpd.apps.json/jscpd-report.json`
  - `apps/web/src` + `apps/workers/src` → `reports/jscpd.web_workers.json/jscpd-report.json`

Artifacts generated:
- .artifacts/openapi.snapshot.json
- reports/jscpd.api.json/jscpd-report.json
- reports/jscpd.apps.json/jscpd-report.json
- reports/jscpd.web_workers.json/jscpd-report.json

Notes & next steps:
- The API dev server still encountered missing module errors until shims were created; these shims are temporary and should be reviewed/refactored.
- jscpd reports are large; next step is to aggregate statistics and produce a top-20 clones list (I can run a robust parser if quieres).
- Recommend: review and commit selective shims or fix real module resolution; also run API smoke tests and fetch live `/v1/openapi.json` when server is stable.

Files modified (temporary shims, not yet committed):
- Multiple `apps/api/src/routes/*.ts` and `.js` shims created to allow dev server to start locally.

Branch: `pr/bootstrapping/local-setup`
